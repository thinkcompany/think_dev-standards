This is a brief guide to help you setup your development environment before contributing to Design System Guide. There are a few things you'll need before starting:

### A Github account

The first thing youâ€™ll need to do is get a free <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> account.

### A Code Editor

We recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads" target="_blank">VSCode</a>. It's fast, free, reliable, and has a massive library of extensions powering it. It also has Git and terminal built in which makes it easy for people new to development.

Microsoft provides a few <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos" target="_blank">intro videos</a> that are helpful to understanding the basics of VSCode. Oh yea, Microsoft makes VSCode.

### Terminal

Access to the command line, or terminal. _The easiest way is to use the terminal built into VSCode_, but you're welcome to use any terminal app you like.

Some terminal options:

- Use the terminal built into VSCode. This is the easiest way to get started.
- For Mac users, the Terminal app is already on your machine. <a href="https://iterm2.com" target="_blank">iTerm2</a> is also a great option.
- For the folks who love javascript, <a href="https://hyper.is" target="_blank">Hyper</a> is an Electron-based terminal

If you're new to using the terminal, take a look at this <a href="https://react.design/terminal" target="_blank">super friendly guide</a>.
