If you are actively contributing to the Design System, you're in the right place. This area explains the logistics and tooling required for contributing to the site.

### For Designers

If you've never worked with Git, Markdown, or Gatsby before we recommend reading through everything in the _Overview_ section. It will give you a good foundation before diving in to the more technical parts.

### For Developers

If you've never worked with Gatsby before, we recommend <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/" target="_blank">reading their guide</a> to get a quick overview. Otherwise, you can dive right into the _Setup Dev Environment_ section.
