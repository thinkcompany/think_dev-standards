Markdown is a shorthand way to write HTML with plain-text-formatting syntax. One of the main benefits is that markdown files are highly portable across many applications and platforms.

> John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format

### MDX

This site also has support for <a href="https://mdxjs.com" target="_blank">MDX</a>. MDX allows you to write JSX (React components) in your Markdown documents.

Below is an example from the MDX guide of JSX embedded in Markdown.

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX</h3>
</div>
