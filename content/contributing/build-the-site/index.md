Now the fun part, let's get this site up and running! Clear out all the messy stuff in the terminal from the previous step with _âŒ˜ + K_. In the terminal, type `gatsby develop`. This will build the entire site based on all the markdown file and JS templates.

Once the build is complete, you'll be able to view the site via this address:

```shell
http://localhost:8000/
```

ðŸ’¥ Boom! You now have your development environment correctly setup and working.
