### Node

Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Gatsby, the technology behind this site, is built with Node.js. The <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system" target="_blank">Gatsby docs</a> have an excellent guide on how to install Node on your machine.

### Gatsby CLI

The Gatsby CLI tool lets you quickly create new Gatsby-powered sites and run commands for developing Gatsby sites. It is a published npm package.

The Gatsby CLI is available via npm and should be installed globally by running:

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

### Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. We have a [helpful list of resources](http://designsystems.thinkcompany.com/contributing/git-for-designers) for designers who are new to git.
