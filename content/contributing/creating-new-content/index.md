### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch in git for the content you're contributing. Be sure to give the branch a name that makes sense based on what you're contributing.

### Choose a Content Area

Choose an area for your content to live:

| Frontmatter Area | Content Folder  |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Blog             | `/blog`         |
| Community        | `/community`    |
| Contributing     | `/contributing` |
| Get Started      | `/get-started`  |
| UI Library       | `/ui-library`   |

### Create Folder and Files

Create a folder for the new content you'll be adding. Remember, the name of the folder determines the URL for the content. See [Folder Structure]() for more details.

### Create Markdown File

In the newly created folder, create a new file and name it `index.md`. This is the markdown file you'll be adding your content to. Any images you need can also be added to this folder.

### Add Frontmatter to Markdown File

The structure for the frontmatter looks like this:

```md
