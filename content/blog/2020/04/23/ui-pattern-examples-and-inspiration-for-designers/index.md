Sometimes when I’m designing something new, or iterating on some features that can use a bit of love, I need a little UI pattern inspiration outside of Googling “UI pattern examples” for the type of industry and project I’m working on. Staring at a blank canvas can be daunting, so finding examples and a source for best practices in UI pattern design helps me to focus, find direction, and move more quickly than I would otherwise.

I decided to hit up my fellow Thinkers to learn more about the resources and inspiration sources they use when jumping into a new design. Here’s what they shared with me, with some additional thoughts and guidance for navigating each resource.

## Resources for UI Pattern Examples

- [Nicely done](https://nicelydone.club/patterns/) is a privately-curated collection of inspiring products, patterns, and UI designs that is updated periodically. This collection has a wide range of browsable filters and includes categories for checkout, dashboard, notification, and shopping cart designs, among many others.
- [Calltoidea](https://www.calltoidea.com/) has a ton of filters as well, with well-curated examples in each section. A team of designers motivated by finding unique inspiration maintains this resource, and it’s focused primarily on usability and simplicity.
- [UI Patterns](https://ui-patterns.com/explore) is a massive collection with many helpfully-specific categories to browse through and explore. The focus isn’t just to supply different ways to solve complex UI problems, but to offer reasoning and rationalization—with the aim of building a more visually-consistent world wide web. I could spend hours poking through each section.
- [Collect UI](https://collectui.com/) is updated daily, so the examples are always fresh and plentiful.
- [Mobbin](https://mobbin.design/) is a beautifully-arranged and extremely useful tool for browsing hand-picked mobile design patterns from apps that reflect the best in design.
