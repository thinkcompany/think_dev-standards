## Why does a link need to be underlined?

The blue, underlined hyperlink is one of the most well established and widely understood conventions of the web. Making changes to that convention should be approached with great care. Using color alone to indicate a link is not strong enough for people with color blindness issues. Combining color and an underline ensures that all people can successfully distinguish a link from regular text.
