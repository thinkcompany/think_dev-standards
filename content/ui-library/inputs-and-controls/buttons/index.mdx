Buttons direct users to take action within an app. Buttons come in many forms and styles and help guide a user in completing a task or navigating an experience.

## When to Use Buttons

Buttons should be used when one or more actions need to be taken or a user needs to be directed to another location within the application. The different types of buttons can be used on any hierarchy group.

### Text Buttons

- Used when an action is straightforward and doesn't need a supporting icon

### Icon + Text Buttons

- Used when a visual indicator will help clarify the action described in the label

### Icon Only Buttons

- These should only be used to align with a platform pattern. There are certain icons that are naturally understood by a user of the platform and don't require a text label to be understood.

## How it Works

Because there are often many buttons on a single screen or page, hierarchy is important to know what buttons are most useful in a situation.

### Primary

Generally there should only be one primary button per screen and/or component at a time. This is reserved for the most relevant and important action to take.

_Example labels: Save, Submit, Create_

### Secondary

If there is more than one button on the page, every button after the primary button will be styled as secondary.

_Example labels: Edit, Add, Cancel_

### Danger

Danger buttons are meant for destructive actions that cannot be recovered.

#### When not to use Danger Buttons

- Don't use danger buttons for basic “cancel” actions.
- Don't use danger buttons for non-destructive actions.
- Don't use multiple danger buttons within a single page, component, or modal.

_Example labels: Delete, Remove_
