The colors outlined below are based on the {CLIENT NAME} Brand Guidelines and will provide a cohesive and consistent aesthetic for its products across various platforms.

To ensure {CLIENT NAME} digital products are accessible for all users, the chosen colors/text + background combinations have been adjusted to provide acceptable color contrast for optimal readability. The contrast ratio of text and interactive elements in {CLIENT NAME} products meet [level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

_User Agent is defined as the browser or platform OS. If you use the default styles provided by the User Agent, then these contrast requirements do not apply. See [WCAG contrast guidelines](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/#sc143) for more info._

| Title         | Ratio                 | Details                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Text \*       | 4.5:1                 | Text 23px and smaller. No smaller than 10px.          |
| Large Text \* | 3.0:1                 | Text 24px and larger                                  |
| Interactive   | 3:1 or User Agent\*   | Button shapes, text inputs, radio buttons, icons, etc |
| General UI    | 1.2:1 or User Agent\* | Borders and background colors                         |

A flexible role-based color system is used to bring structure to the decision making process. Color values are given specific names derived from their purpose. This structure makes for a seamless transition to assign a new set of color values for the same roles to create a dark mode UI.

## Color Groups

The three color groups suggest when colors should be used:

| Semantic Group | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tints          | Tint colors will primarily signify action or call attention to different parts of the UI.                                                                                     |
| Backgrounds    | Background colors are meant to be a surface for tints, foregrounds or other backgrounds to be placed upon.                                                                    |
| Foregrounds    | Foreground colors are primarily used for non-interactive text or elements that support text such as dividers, text fields, etc. They are meant to be placed onto backgrounds. |

### Light Mode vs. Dark Mode

In the assigned colors section, you will find a set of colors defined for both a light mode UI experience and dark mode. The colors should never be mixed between the two modes.

When a product is built the user will be able to switch between seeing the UI in light mode or dark mode. The system will swap the full set of colors assigned in the light mode over to the colors assigned for dark mode.

## The Colors

Using the color groups and assigned colors defined in this section, you can apply colors to UI objects based on the function of the object and what layer it is placed on. (For example, in both Light and Dark Mode if you have a button filled with Tint Primary, any label/icon placed on that Tint should use the Foreground On Tint color.)

### Tints

| Name                  | Value   |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Tint Blue Primary     | #4640ED |
| Tint Blue Secondary   | #D2D0FB |
| Tint Green Primary    | #77D59D |
| Tint Green Secondary  | #B1E7C7 |
| Tint Red Primary      | #D5403C |
| Tint Red Secondary    | #EDADAB |
| Tint Orange Primary   | #FFAF62 |
| Tint Orange Secondary | #FFD3A8 |

### Backgrounds

| Name                 | Value   |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Background Primary   | #FFFFFF |
| Background Secondary | #EEEFF3 |
| Background Tertiary  | #DEE0E8 |

### Foregrounds

| Name                 | Value   |
| -------------------- | ------- |
| Foreground Primary   | #333333 |
| Foreground Secondary | #666666 |
| Foreground Tertiary  | #939AB4 |
| Foreground On Tint   | #FFFFFF |

## Research on Color

The role-based system of colors is derived from this article by SÃ¸ren Clausen.

### Color contrast

- The contrast ratio of text and interactive elements will meet [level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).
