#Browser Compatibility QA

**CSS Prefixing (to enhance with the latest and greatest Browser features)**
**Automated Selenium browser testing, which allows us to record and play back clicks across the site UI**
**Manual Browserstack testing which allows us to test every operating system, mobile or desktop, and every browser**
**Visual regression testing, which uses previously mentioned Selenium automation to capture and then run visual difference checks between versions of your site**
**Verify that only necessary CSS vendor prefixes are present (Autoprefixer)**
**Add a prefixer to your build setup**
**Run automated Selenium / Browserstack browser testing**
**Add automated testing via gulp**
**Use Firefox addon to create your testsuiteselenium/?at=development**
**Review pages manually using Browserstack, virtual machines or emulators in all required browsers**
**Run automated visual regression tests (PhantomCSS, Backstop)**
**Document how each browser / OS combination was tested**
