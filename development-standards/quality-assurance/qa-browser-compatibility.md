#Browser Compatibility QA

**Autoprefix CSS**

Using a tool like Autoprefix allows us to use tomorrows CSS today. It works by applying each browsers prefix when necessary, that way you don't have to worry about using obsolete/unecssary prefixes.

**Use Browserstack to test different platforms/browsers**

Browserstack allows us to test a website in multiple device, OS, and browser combinations. You should test each browser/device/OS combination based on the requirements of the project.

**Visual and functional regression testing**

Whenever you make a change on a project, it can impact the design and functionality of other parts. Visual regression testing uses automation to compare changes visually and ensure nothing accidentally breaks. Functional regression testing works similarly by making scripting certain interactions a user may perform and making sure the intended functionality occurs. (ToDo: maybe list what tools could be used here.)

**Add automated testing via gulp**

**Document how each browser / OS combination was tested**

It is important to document your testing methods. Doing so allows us to account for the changes made and be aware of any other testing that may need to be performed.
