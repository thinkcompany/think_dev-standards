#Standards Compliance QA

This section ensures that the project adheres to our internal coding standards and code management processes.

[ ] **Follow Git Flow standards when committing changes**

We typically use the [Git Flow process](https://thinkbrownstone.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/Git+Flow) for code management. It includes a branching strategy that works well for our typical development approach.

[ ] **Adhere to code review process**

Part of our git flow process includes using pull requests, and subsequent code reviews, prior to merging code into the main development branch.

[ ] **Verify all code is DRY-compliant**

Strive to write code as DRY as possible ([Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)).

[ ] **Follow the conventions of the frameworks/libraries included in the project**

When you are using a framework or library, it is a good practice to follow its accepted standards and conventions. 

[ ] **Adhere to client's desired directory structure/file naming conventions**

Clients may have their own standards for code quality, conventions, and structure. We need to work within those when required.

[ ] **Write HTML/CSS/JavaScript according to our team standards**

Follow our established coding standards (in this repo!). 

[ ] **Validate HTML/CSS/JavaScript**

Validate [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) according to WC3 Specifications and lint all JavaScript using our shared ESLint configuration.

HTML and CSS should be linted as well using these standard tools and our linter configurations.

**Lint back-end code (using tools like PHP Lint)**

Linting should be also be used for any code written in additional languages, including PHP.
