#Codebase Integrity QA

**Remove unused assets and scripts from the project**
**Verify all dependencies are included, and unused dependencies are removed**
**Document custom functions (JS / PHP Doc Blocks) (Dev Leads should verify documentation has been included)**
**Include pre-compiled source files (Sass / Less) if required**
**Verify that file / directory structure is clear, FLAT, and consistent**
**Verify the project README has appropriate level of detail for new developers, and is up to date with the latest information**
