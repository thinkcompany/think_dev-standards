1. Start by creating a new directory for the project
2. Clone down any development utilities, templates, etc
3. Create a `.gitignore` file and add typical files/directories, like `.DS_Store` for example
4. Create a `README.md` file and document everything you do from this point on (minus any credentials)
5. Initialize your repository by running `git init`
6. Add all of the files in your project by running `git add -A`
7. Commit your changes by running `git commit -m 'whatever message makes most sense'`
8. Follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) to publish this new repository to Github
